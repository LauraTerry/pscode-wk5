// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

Ask the user for the first number
Ask the user for a second number
The program will add these two numbers together
Tell the user what the result is

Actual code:

a = input("Please provide a whole number for a: ")

b = input("Please provide a whole number for b: ")

sum = int(a) + int(b)

print ("The sum of these two numbers are: ", sum)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Ask the use to input a whole number
Have the program divide the number by 2 and give a result
If the number is able to be divided by 2 with no remainder the result is even
If the number has remainder or is unable to be divided by 2 the number is odd

Actual code:

num = int (input ("Is the number even or odd? Find out! Enter a whole number here: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
	print ("The number is even")
else:
	print ("The number is odd")


// Exercise 3: 

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Ask the user to input 5 whole numbers
the code will divide the numbers up into seperate values represented by letters
the code will add the numbers together, then divide the sum of those by 5
Tell the user if the result is even or odd

Actual code:

print("Let's find the average of 5 numbers!")
a, b, c, d, e =input("Please enter 5 whole numbers seperated by a space ").split()
sum = int(a)+int(b)+int(c)+int(d)+int(e)
sum/5
print("The average of these 5 numbers is: ", sum)
